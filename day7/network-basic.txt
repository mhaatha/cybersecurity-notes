INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK BASICS
A network is two or more computers or devices that are linked in order to share information.

TYPES OF NETWORKS
Networks are broken into different subsets based on their size and function. Here are some of the most common network types:
- LAN
A Local Area Network is a smaller network that connects multiple devices in a limited area. Examples of LANs include small offices, a home, or any other network contained within a small area.

- CAN
A Campus Area Network connects multiple computers and devices over a slightly larger area. In many cases, these types of networks will connect multiple buildings located in the same vicinity.

- WAN
A Wide Area Network connects multiple computers over a geographically large area. Large, international organizations may operate these types of networks. To ensure that computers spread over large regions are able to communicate, companies may use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to connect systems securely

Since weâ€™re all connected to the Internet, the whole Internet can technically be classified as a WAN!
