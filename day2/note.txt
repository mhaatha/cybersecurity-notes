WHAT IS CYBERCRIME?
Cybercrime is any crime that makes use of or targets a computer.
Cybercrime types:
- Extortion: Commonly in the form of ransomware.
- Fraud: Identity theft, scams, phishing, and more.
- Theft: Stealing information, or theft of services and resources.

WHAT IS DIGITAL FORENSICS?
Digital Forensics is the process of gathering the evidence of a cybercrime in a way that the evidence can be used in a court of law. Including:
- Disk Forensics: Investigating storage media.
- Memory Forensics: Investigating live memory (RAM) on a digital device.
- Network Forensics: Invetigating network traffic.	
- Mobile Forensics: Investigating mobile devices.
- Cloud Forensics: Investigating cloud environments.
The most important aspect of digital forensics is maintaining a chain of custody to prove that the data and evidence have not been modified or tampered with.

REGULATIONS
 The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) is a US law that is used to prosecute cybercrime.
The broad scope of the CFAA means that it is used to prosecute a wide variety of cybercrime, including:
- Intrusion into networks and systems.
- Malware attacks.
- Theft of data and trade secrets.
- Denial of service attacks (DoS).
3 sets of regulations:
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): is a U.S. federal law designed to modernize various aspects of healthcare and insurance. Protect PHI (Protected Health Information) from cybercrime.
- GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act): is a U.S. federal law governing financial institutions. Protect costumer information.
- PCI DDS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): is a regulation developed by credit card companies and governing merchants that handle credit card data.

FRAMEWORK
The NIST Framework is an optional framework published by NIST, originally developed to protect critical infrastructure in the US from cyber threats.
The NIST framework consists of five main elements:
- Identify: Identify and understand the threats and risks the organization is likely to face.
- Protect: Protect the organizationâ€™s assets from those threats and risks.
- Detect: Detect incidents, such as cyberattacks or other events.
- Respond: Respond to incidents, preventing further damage.
- Recover: Recover from incidents, evaluating how to prevent reoccurrence cleaning up any damage that occurred.
Frameworks are not generally a one-size-fits-all solution to cybersecurity. Instead, they are a starting point for organizations to customize to their needs and threats.
