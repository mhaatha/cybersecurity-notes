WINDOWS HARDENING
- Windows Quirks To Consider
Microsoft tries to make sure that old software and hardware will continue to function with new versions of Windows software. While maintaining compability has its benefits, it also creates some inconsistent rules.

Basic Windows Hardening Checklist
Account Setup
Force accounts to have passwords
- Open the “Run” app by searching for it or using Win+ r.
- Type netplwiz into the dialog box and click “OK”.
- Check the box labeled “Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer.” in the “User Accounts” window.

Limit administrator privileges to only necessary accounts
- From the same “User Accounts” window, you can set whether or not accounts have administrator privileges.
- Select an account that you want to add or remove administrator privileges from, then click “Properties”.
- In the new window, switch to the “Group Membership” tab, and select “Standard User” or “Administrator” as appropriate.

Require Log In on Screensaver
- Open the “Settings” app.
- Go to the “Accounts” section.
- Go to the “Sign-in options” section in the sidebar.
- Under the “Require sign-in” header, select “When PC wakes up from sleep”

Windows Security Features
Turn on Windows Firewall
- Open the “Windows Security” app.
- Go to “Firewall & network protection”.
- Ensure that the domain, private, and public networks all have their firewall enabled.

Turn on Windows Built-In Antivirus
- Open the “Windows Security” app.
- Go to “Virus & threat protection”.
- Go to “Virus & threat protection settings”.
- Turn on “Real-time protection”, “Cloud-delivered protection”, “Automatic sample submission”, and “Tamper Protection”.

Miscellaneous Best Practices
Disable Remote Access
- Open the “Control Panel” app.
- Go to “System and Security” (You may need to change the view settings to “view by category”).
- Go to “System”.
- Go to “Remote settings”
- Under the “Remote” tab, uncheck the “Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer” box.
- Depending on your version of Windows, there may be another similar feature you need to disable:

- Go to “System”.
- Go to “Remote Desktop”.
- If your version of windows has the remote desktop feature, turn it off.

Allow Automatic Microsoft Software Updates
- Open the “Settings” app.
- Go to “Update & Security”.
- Go to “Advanced Options”.
- Turn “Receive updates for other Microsoft products when you update Windows” on.

Advanced Windows Hardening Techniques
Some measures spend more computer resources, slowing down your system, or cause networking issues in certain environments. Always be sure to do your research on the benefits, drawbacks, and potential complications of a technique before choosing to apply it!

Uninstall Unused Programs
There’s no point having programs that you don’t use sitting around on your computer; at best, they take up space, and at worst they provide extra tools for attackers to make use of. It’s good to scan through the list of programs in case any of them were downloaded accidentally. Be careful to distinguish from critical programs for the OS.

Encryption
- Some versions of Windows come with options for encrypting the hard drive, such as Bitlocker.
- Self-encrypting drives are hard drives with built-in encryption.

Backups
- Some versions of Windows have the option of automatic backups using File History, and an extra hard drive.
- There are many cloud-based backup services available to consumers such as OneDrive and DropBox.
- Creating local backups using an external hard drive is also an option, and there are many ways to do it.

Add Extra Security Software
While Windows’ built-in antivirus is usually adequate, it may not be enough in special situations, such as when securing a not so tech-savvy family member’s computer. In these cases, it’s worth it to invest in additional security software that offer a full suite of protection and features. Kaspersky and Bitdefender are two well-regarded names in consumer security software, but you can look at a variety of recent guides to determine what suite will meet your needs.
